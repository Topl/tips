## Abstract

This TIP specifies the implementation of Topl's heirarchical deterministic wallet. Building on Bitcoin's BIP-0032 and improvements to allow the use of Ed25519 keys, this allows for a tree of keypairs to be generated from a given seed and a wallet structure to be added that is compliant for use with the Topl blockchain and other wallets or applications.

## Motivation

Based on the specific asymmetric key cryptography and architectural decisions made in creating the Topl blockchain protocol, an amalgamation of standards is needed to properly implement a hierarchical deterministic wallet that is compatible with the Topl blockchain. This document describes in detail the standards and implementation-level specifics required to implement an HD wallet that is fully compatible and interoperable with the Topl blockchain and ecosystem.
